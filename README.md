**Project: Sync'd**
*A private, period tracker that helps you stay in sync with your partner - one mood update or snack at a time*

*Sync'd is an intuitive period tracker that helps foster communication between partners. This easy to use interface allows a person 
to update their partner about their mood, period symptoms, cravings, and even send messages. Life is stresful when you're on your
period, and Sync'd is designed to bridge the disconnect where words fail to reach. It allows you to communicate easily in real
time, stress free, and is designed to be that extra layer of support when you need it. Why be apart when you can be Sync'd!*
